Make sure to install all the dependencies for this to work. And then you'll have to make the .env file with the process.env parts of the server. Which means you will have to have a auth0 account to put in the domain, clientID, and clientSecret in the .env file. And then make a session secret which can be anything. And for the NODE_ENV just make it equal to 'dev' in the .env file. Then you should be good to go.
